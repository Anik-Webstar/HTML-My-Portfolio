 <h1>The Greatest Bands According to Aniket</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 Most Favourite Bands of All Time</h2>

 <hr />

<h3>The Beatles</h3>
<p>In popular music, nothing mattered until The Beatles came along. They would go on on to change our perception of music. 4 of the most egocentric musicians came together to form the greatest bands of all time.Their unusual chord progressions in their psychedelic albums(Revokver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band etc.) paved the way for psychedelic rock</p>

<h3>Led Zeppelin</h3>
<p>The greatest Hard ROCK band of all time.Formed by one of the Greatest Guitarists pf all time, Jimmy Page, it overcame all its expections by becoming the quitessential rock band. The heavy riifs of Page, The Bonham Shuffle, The badass Plant Vocals and the groovy bass lines of John Paul Jones are some of the infinite number of reasons why musicians are still studying the works of Led Zeppelin</p>

<h3>Pink Floyd</h3>
<p>The greatest progressive rock band of all time</p>
